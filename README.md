=======================================

This application is a skeleton to show how should be configured FPOpenId with
FOSUserBundle.

1) Installation
---------------

Once you've downloaded the standard edition, installation is easy, and basically
involves making sure your system is ready for Symfony.

### a) Check your System Configuration

Before you begin, make sure that your local system is properly configured
for Symfony. To do this, execute the following:

    php app/check.php

If you get any warnings or recommendations, fix these now before moving on.

### b) Install the Vendor Libraries

    php bin/vendors install

### c) Access the Application via the Browser

Congratulations! You're now ready to use Symfony. If you've unzipped Symfony
in the web root of your computer, then you should be able to access the
web version of the Symfony requirements check via:

    http://localhost/Symfony/web/config.php

If everything looks good, click the "Bypass configuration and go to the Welcome page"
link to load up your first Symfony page.

You can also use a web-based configurator by clicking on the "Configure your
Symfony Application online" link of the ``config.php`` page.

To see a real-live Symfony page in action, access the following page:

    web/app_dev.php/demo/hello/Fabien
